                                <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free
                                    society, transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens.
                                    It is at the heart of how citizens hold their public officials
                                    accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.</p>
                                <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the
                                    public business and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily
                                    understood. This transparency allows good and just governance.
                                    Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about
                                    what their Government is doing.</p>
                                <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances
                                    the Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge
                                    is widely dispersed in society, and public officials
                                    benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our
                                    site to become actively engaged in American government.</p>
                                <p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use.
                                    We solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.

                                <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and
                                    susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment,
                                    when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine
                                    of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal
                                    legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for
                                    example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed
                                    territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of
                                    the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is
                                    strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century
                                    public sphere.

                                    <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France
                                        (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public
                                        budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional
                                        articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row
                                        back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal
                                        politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent
                                        among the latter.</p>

                                    <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic
                                        practice and is often linked to the passing of freedom of information
                                        legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first
                                        freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions
                                        to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness
                                        after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
                                        Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs,
                                        Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and
                                        Norway in 1970.</p>
